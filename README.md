# Bigdataviewer Bioformats Bridge 

This repository enables the opening of files into BigDataViewer by using the BioFormats API.
Emphasis has been put on correct support of metadata for locating multiple series of acquisition, like in slide scanner file.

Multiresolition file formats supported by BioFormats are translated into a BigDataViewer multiresolution source, enabling support for 'big' files.

File format tested:
* JPEG
* PNG
* VSI
* ND2

VSI example video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuiaEXmFVyE

In theory all files supported by the Bioformats API can be opened using this package.

## Limitations:
* Signed pixels values are not supported (yet)

## Usage:
* Update Site to be done
